I’m a PhD student in [Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS)](https://eecs.mit.edu) at [Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)](https://mit.edu) , under the supervision of [Bonnie Berger](https://people.csail.mit.edu/bab). I graduated with a double major in [Computer Science and Molecular Biology](http://catalog.mit.edu/degree-charts/computer-science-molecular-biology-course-6-7/) and [Mathematics](https://math.mit.edu) from MIT in 2020. 

I partake a general interest in developing novel algorithms for applications in bioinformatics and computational genomics. More specifically, my [research](/publications/) focuses on designing efficient and accurate algorithms and developing software for next-generation sequencing (NGS) data.

I enjoy [composing and producing music](/about/), speedcubing, reading, cat videos on YouTube, and a good game of [Catan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catan), [Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(card_game)), or [Smash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Smash_Bros.) every now and then.
